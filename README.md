# Scheduler
An app that allows for users to schedule appointments with providers. Users submit appointment requests which are reviewed by schedulers. Users can be edited by admins. Appointments can have services attached for cost estimates.

## Install

To install this app, clone the repository. Then, navigate to its directory in your command line and run

```
$ bundle install
```

After that, the app should be useable. I used shotgun to view and interact with it, but you can use whatever works for you!
